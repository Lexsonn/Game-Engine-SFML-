# Game-Engine-SFML-
Game Engine created with C++ using multimedia library SFML.

The goal of the game engine will be a top-down fantasy adventure game like (2D) Legend of Zelda or Binding of Issac.

Feel free to use any part of the code in whatever project you'd like. If you use it, please credit me with whatever part I helped out with.

The walking animation sprite "GameEngine/Resources/Images/PlayerWalk.png" is a temporary sprite I found at http://www.xnaresources.com/images/tutorialimages/multitile/T_Vlad_Sword_Walking_48x48.png. I did not create nor in any way own the image.
